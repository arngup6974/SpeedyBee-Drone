This repository contains the design-phase documentation for an FPV (First-Person View) drone project. The work presented here focuses on subsystem research, component-level understanding, and structured team documentation rather than a completed physical build.

The project did not involve software development. Instead, it emphasizes hardware planning, mechanical integration considerations, and engineering documentation practices.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were to:
Research and document the function of each major drone subsystem
Evaluate and justify component selection based on performance and compatibility
Establish clear documentation of individual team contributions
Design a mechanically feasible drone-mounted claw as a conceptual attachment
Subsystem Research and Documentation
The repository includes written documentation covering:
Frame and structural components
Motors, propellers, and thrust generation
Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) and power distribution
Battery selection and power management
FPV system components, including camera, transmitter, and antenna
Each subsystem is explained in terms of function, integration considerations, and selection rationale.

Component Selection Rationale

Component selection was guided by:
Expected performance characteristics (thrust, efficiency, durability)
Weight and balance constraints
Electrical and mechanical compatibility
Safety considerations and competition constraints
Research notes summarize how these factors influenced design decisions.

Team Contribution Logging

A contribution log was maintained to:
Record individual responsibilities and completed tasks
Track research, documentation, and design work
Ensure transparency and accountability within the team
This structure mirrors documentation practices used in professional engineering environments.

Mechanical Design: Drone-Mounted Claw

The project includes the conceptual design of a single drone-mounted mechanical claw. This work focused on mechanical feasibility and integration planning rather than fabrication or testing.
Design considerations included:
Mounting compatibility with the drone frame
Weight and balance impact
Gripping geometry and structural simplicity
The claw was modeled to explore constraints involved in aerial manipulation.
